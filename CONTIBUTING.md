# Contributing

Contributing to this project is as easy as eating a cake, but first you need to buy one to eat it. So read the following sub-sections of contributing to know more about this project. I'll keep it as short and sweet as possible.

This project is one of the components that I'm developing as a part of a big project and open-sourcing it so that the our fellow can use it so let's keep it fun.

## New Ideas
---

Ideas or feature set that you are thinking of is always welcome. First [create a issue](https://github.com/printzero/tint/issues/new) with label `idea`. This will help me notice that there is a new incoming idea and add it to the trello board.

It is always better to add a pull request with your ideas. This helps you add the feature that you want the way you want it and I can also realize the potential of it. Read the below guide to create a pull request.

## Creating pull-request with a new idea
---

> **NOTE:** Please start coding your idea once it is added to the trello board. This helps us align our goals of this project and does not add any idea that would need a bigger change and/or stop any other developments.

* Always [Create a pull request](https://github.com/printzero/tint/compare) to [develop](https://github.com/printzero/tint/tree/develop) branch so that we can add some tests to it before merging it to master.
* Tests with pull request are always welcome. This is a single file project so write inside `tint_test.go`.
* Create a pull request to merge inside `develop` branch.
